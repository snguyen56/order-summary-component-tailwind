## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Utility-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build Tool
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting

### What I learned

Nothing new was encountered in this challenge. The only issue I had was the svg for the hero image did not render at first, but that was because I tried to convert it to the React format for its attributes. Other than that, the challenge was more of a refresher of the basics of frontend.

### Continued development

As I aim for visual accuracy with these challenges, I often have to use arbitrary values with Tailwind. This tends to lead to accidental repetition of styling code if I'm not careful. I need to keep a closer eye on this issue moving forward and try to not repeat myself in code.
